Andro Labs [Work in progress 🚧]
==================

**Andro Labs** is an in-development Android app being built with Java[^1], Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It follows Android design and development best practices and is centred around "**tablet-first**" thinking. The app is intended to help developers develop Android apps on mobile devices while providing all of the necessary tools. In addition, the app is also intended to be used as a source to learn Android development.

The app is currently in early stages of development and is not yet ready to be used.
