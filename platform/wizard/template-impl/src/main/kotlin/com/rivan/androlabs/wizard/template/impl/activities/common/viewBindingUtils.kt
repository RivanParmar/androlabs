 * Replaces the findViewById call with the equivalent of view binding.
 *
 * @param language the language of the template that calls findViewById
 * @param isViewBindingSupported indicates if the caller supports view binding
 * @param id String representation of the id
 * @param bindingName name of the variable of the view binding class.
 *        E.g. used in a form of ${bidingName}.${id}. "binding" is used as a default value
 * @param className name of the class if the obtained view needs explicit cast
 * @param parentView name of the parent view if exists. Usually called from a class that doesn't
 *        have findViewById method. E.g. Fragment
