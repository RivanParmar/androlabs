 The C\C++ structured log file format is a series of self-delimited
 [StructuredLogRecord] message.

 The [NewString] message creates a new string with ID equal to one
 plus the prior ID. The ID itself is not embedded in the message
 and the caller must keep track of the IDs as they arrive and
 increment a counter.

 The [NewList] message creates a new list with ID equal to one
 plus the prior ID. The ID itself is not embedded in the message
 and the caller must keep track of the IDs as they arrive and
 increment a counter.

 The [PayloadHeader] message indicates that a user-defined, delimited payload
 message is arriving next in the stream.
